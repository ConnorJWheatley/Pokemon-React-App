# Pokemon-React-App
Using new knowledge from React courses to create a webapp that uses a Pokemon API to display data.

## Before running the app

`npm install`

## Run the application
In the main project directory you can use the command:

This will run the app in development mode and will open in your browser at http://localhost:3000.
